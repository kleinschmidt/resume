\makecvtitle

I'm a technical leader with more than 10 years of experience making complex ideas, data, and
systems legible to experts and beginners alike.  I have a track record of shipping software
that people actually use, a passion for making computational tools broadly useful for humans
through open source software, and a knack for both building things right and building the
right things.  I'm a pragmatic generalist who's worn lots of different hats, communicates
well, is motivated by curiosity, and learns on my feet.

\section{Experience}

\cventry{2022--present}{Senior Algorithm Engineer (Technical Lead)}{Beacon
  Biosignals}{Remote}{} {Lead Beacon's first effort for \textbf{productionization,
    deployment, and operation} of business-critical data ingest and ML processes.  This
  evolved into Beacon's \textbf{service framework/platform} for productionization of
  algorithms/processes.  Led transformation of services to \textbf{event pub/sub
    architecture (Kafka)}.  Built out Beacon's \textbf{quantitative science and algorithm
    development platform}, including: designing and implementing a data
  provenance/versioning system that is used by all algorithm and data science teams; a
  distributed ML training/evaluation capability
  (\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szjMOSuUYU4}{JuliaCon talk on batch building
    library}).  Developed a \href{https://github.com/beacon-biosignals/Ray.jl}{Julia Ray
    runtime}.}

\cventry{2021--2022}{Research Scientist}{Beacon Biosignals}{Remote}{}{Developed,
  applied, and interpreted novel statistical and machine learning models to
  provide insight into human EEG data for industry partners.  Tech
  lead and project manager for quantitative science team handling Beacon's first
  large contract: cleaned, featurized, and analyzed 10,000s of overnight EEG
  recordings from a Phase 3 clinical trial.}

\cventry{2013--present}{Open source maintainer}{JuliaStats}{Distributed/remote}{}
{Maintain and develop open source software
  for statistical modeling in the Julia language.  Write code and documentation,
  review contributions, manage releases and automated testing/CI.  Primary
  developer of \textbf{StatsModels.jl},
  \href{https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/StatsModels/}{used in
    100+ packages} to transform tabular data to numerical arrays for modeling.}

\cventry{2018--2021}{Assistant Professor of Psychology}{Rutgers
  University}{New Brunswick, NJ}{}{Directed computational cognitive science lab;
  Supervised graduate research assistants and staff.  Designed, implemented (custom
  node.js+MongoDB backend), and analyzed data (using R and Julia) from \textbf{online
    behavioral experiments}.  Designed and implemented ML cognitive models.}

\cventry{2016--2018}{CV Starr Postdoctoral Fellow}{Princeton Neuroscience
  Institute}{Princeton, NJ}{}{Implemented \textbf{Bayesian nonparametric
    models} of human perception and categorization.  Co-designed and ran \textbf{weekly
  open workshop on statistical philosophy and methods} for PhD students and other
  post-docs (regression, hierarchical models, Bayesian methods).}

% \cventry{2010--2016}{PhD research}{Brain and Cognitive Sciences, University of
%   Rochester}{Rochester, NY}{}{Created \textbf{novel Bayesian theory of
%     perceptual learning for speech}, custom Bayesian samplers, web-based audio
%   psychophysics platform, data management systems, and ML pipelines for fMRI data.}

% \cventry{2009--2010}{Baggett Fellow}{Linguistics, University of
%   Maryland}{College Park, MD}{}{}
